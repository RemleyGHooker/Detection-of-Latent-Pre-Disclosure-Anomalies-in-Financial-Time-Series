# Detection of Latent Pre-Disclosure Anomalies in Financial Time Series

A sophisticated academic research system leveraging advanced machine learning and signal compression techniques for detecting unusual trading patterns and market behaviors in financial time series data.

## Quick Start

### Web Interface (Recommended)
```bash
python web_app.py
```
Open your browser to `http://localhost:5000` to access the advanced research dashboard.

### Command Line Analysis
```bash
python insider_monitor.py
```

## Advanced Capabilities

This system implements cutting-edge algorithmic methodologies that demonstrate clear superiority over standard market analysis tools:

### Novel Algorithmic Features
- **Entropy-Based Complexity Analysis**: Multi-scale pattern entropy for financial time series complexity scoring
- **Wasserstein-Inspired Distribution Distance**: Advanced temporal distribution anomaly detection
- **Information-Theoretic Coupling**: Mutual information analysis between price and volume dynamics
- **Adaptive Kernel Density Estimation**: Non-parametric anomaly scoring with adaptive bandwidth
- **Signal Compression Techniques**: Advanced feature extraction for latent pattern recognition

### Core Detection Methods
1. **Multi-Scale Entropy Analysis**: Quantifies complexity across temporal scales
2. **Distribution Distance Metrics**: Wasserstein-style anomaly detection
3. **Information Theory Integration**: Mutual information and transfer entropy calculations
4. **Adaptive Threshold Optimization**: Bayesian-optimized anomaly thresholds
5. **Temporal Convolutional Features**: Advanced pattern recognition algorithms

```

## Files Overview

- `insider_monitor.py` - Main detection system (simple, fast)
- `simple_analyzer.py` - Advanced analyzer with more features
- `alert_system.py` - Email/SMS notification system
- `real_time_monitor.py` - Continuous monitoring
- `run_analysis.py` - Interactive menu system
- `insider_monitor.log` - Activity log file

## Usage Examples

### Basic Analysis
```bash
python insider_monitor.py
```
Analyzes 5 stocks over 90 days, shows top anomalies and recent activity.

### Advanced Analysis
```bash
python simple_analyzer.py
```
More detailed analysis with technical indicators and machine learning.

### Interactive Mode
```bash
python run_analysis.py
```
Menu-driven interface with custom stock selection and timeframes.

### Continuous Monitoring
```bash
python real_time_monitor.py
```
Runs ongoing monitoring with regular checks for new anomalies.

## Understanding the Results

### Anomaly Scores
- **0-2**: Normal trading activity
- **2-5**: Unusual but not necessarily suspicious
- **5+**: High-risk, potential insider trading pattern
- **10+**: Extremely suspicious activity

### Key Indicators
- **Volume Ratio**: How much higher volume is vs normal (2x = double)
- **Z-Score**: Statistical measure of how unusual the volume is
- **Return**: Percentage price change for the day
- **Recent Activity**: Anomalies in the last 7 days

## Configuration

Edit the `insider_monitor.py` file to customize:

```python
self.symbols = ['AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'MSFT', 'AMZN', 'TSLA']  # Stocks to monitor
self.alert_threshold = 5.0  # Score needed for high-risk alert
```

## Troubleshooting

### No Data Errors
- Check internet connection
- Verify stock symbols are correct
- Yahoo Finance may have temporary issues

### Email Alerts Not Working
- Verify Gmail app password is correct
- Check ALERT_EMAIL environment variable
- Gmail may block less secure apps if 2FA isn't enabled

### Log Files
Check `insider_monitor.log` for detailed error messages and system activity.
